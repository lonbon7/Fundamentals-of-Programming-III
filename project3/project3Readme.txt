Justification for quadratic probe method

Our insert method inserts an item at the very first possible chance it can get.
Our find method works in the same way. Therefore, if and item is in the table,
it will be found before an empty spot is found (empty or inactive). This is why
we stop our quadratic probing is an empty or inactive table value is found.
